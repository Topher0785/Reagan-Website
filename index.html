        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>
            Reagan loves more than anything to do crafts. It doesnt matter if it
            is coloring a picture, making slime, or building a gingerbread House
            she is all in. Other interests include Disney Princesses and riding 
            her razor.

            <h2>What I dont like</h2>
            <p>
                As you can see from my photo, that while I love to eat, I dont love
                to go out to eat. I dont love homework unless it has to do with coloring.
                Then finally I really dont like the tv shows my mom and dad watch.

            <h2> Reagans Favorite People</h2>
            <p>
                While Reagan is like many other children, She has two very special people
                in her life. Her Nan (short for Nanny. Its her Grandma) and her new little 
                brother "Sammy Gray J". Reagan loves her mom and dad and her Grand and Pop,
                to her there is no one she'd rather be with than her "Butta" she is "jelly" 
                so they are a team.

            <p>
                Reagan is 6 years old, and in first grade. Her birthday is 
                April 2 which makes her one of the youngest in her class. 
                While The kid doesnt really care for school, she does like 
                W.B.E. much better than her old school.
